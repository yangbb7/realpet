"""Unified pet detector using torchvision Faster R-CNN (BSD-3-Clause).

Replaces all Ultralytics YOLOv8 (AGPL-3.0) usage with a license-friendly
detector. The detector ONLY provides the first-frame bbox for SAM2 seeding
and app confirmation — it does NOT affect segmentation quality (SAM2 Apache
+ BiRefNet MIT handle that).

Model: fasterrcnn_resnet50_fpn_v2 (COCO pre-trained).
Threshold: 0.35 (tuned to match yolov8n conf=0.3 recall on pet classes).

COCO pet class IDs (there is NO rabbit/hamster in COCO — yolov8n never
detected those either, so removing them is not a regression):
